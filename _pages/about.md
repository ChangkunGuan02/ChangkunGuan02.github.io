I am a second year Computer Science Ph.D. student at University of Southern California advised by Professor [Bistra Dilkina](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Dilkina/Bistra). I am affilated with USC Center for Artificial Intelligence[(CAIS)](https://cais.usc.edu/) and Artificial Intelligence Institute for Advances in Optimization[(AI4OPT)](https://www.ai4opt.org/). I am interested in the combination of machine learning and optimization and solving real-world optimization problems.
