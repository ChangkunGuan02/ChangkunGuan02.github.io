I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Operations Research at the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE), Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics (Honors, Concentration in Statistics) and B.A. in Computer Science from Bucknell University, graduating **Summa Cum Laude**.

My research interests lie in **optimization** and **applied mathematics**, with a focus on:

- Combinatorial optimization and integer programming  
- Precedence-constrained knapsack problems  
- Covering arrays and combinatorial interaction testing  
- Matrix analysis and numerical methods

I have worked on projects involving the precedence-constrained quadratic knapsack problem (honors thesis), the structure of optimal covering arrays under constraints, and Crouzeix’s conjecture for nilpotent matrices. My work has led to a published honors thesis and an accepted paper in *Concrete Operator*.
