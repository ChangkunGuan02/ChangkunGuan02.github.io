I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Operations Research at Georgia Institute of Technology's H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE). Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics (Honors, Concentration in Statistics) and B.A. in Computer Science from Bucknell University, graduating Summa Cum Laude.

My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization and applied mathematics, with a particular focus on:

* **Combinatorial Optimization:** Developing exact solution methods and heuristics for complex combinatorial problems, including precedence-constrained quadratic knapsack problems and covering array optimization.
* **Mathematical Modeling:** Formulating and solving optimization problems using mathematical programming techniques, with applications in operations research and applied mathematics.
* **Algorithm Design:** Creating efficient algorithms and computational tools for solving optimization problems, implemented in Python, Gurobi, and Mathematica.

I have conducted research on precedence-constrained quadratic knapsack problems, optimal covering arrays, and Crouzeix's conjecture for nilpotent matrices. My honors thesis on the Precedence-Constrained Quadratic Knapsack Problem has been published in Bucknell's digital commons, and my work on Crouzeix's conjecture was accepted to Concrete Operator and presented at the Joint Mathematics Meetings 2023.
