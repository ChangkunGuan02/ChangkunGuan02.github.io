Formed an exact solution method to solve the Precedence-constrained quadratic knapsack problem. Experimented with heuristics and metaheuristics to solve the problem and generated difficult instances. Finalized the thesis and submitted to Bucknell digitalcommons.

**Thesis Advisor:** Dr. Lucas Waddell

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed exact solution methods for precedence-constrained quadratic knapsack problems
- Implemented and tested various heuristics and metaheuristics
- Generated challenging problem instances for benchmarking
- Published honors thesis in Bucknell digitalcommons
